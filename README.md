# Titan-lab #

### What is this repository for? ###

* An Nvidia GPU enabled JupyterLab server for AI and computer vision development and learning.
* Version 1.0
* [Learn Markdown](https://bitbucket.org/tutorials/markdowndemo)


### How do I get set up? ###

* This version is too easy. Just log enter the supplied URL
* into your browser, and then once you're connected, input
* your supplied token and begin working.
  
* It's recommended to create a venv or anaconda-based
* kernel for each project you work on, so your dependencies
* will stay in line.

* This is running within a Docker container of Ubuntu 22.04
* with CUDA 8.1 and CUDNN 8.9. So the file system in this
* sandbox is not the same as the file system for the host
* server itself.

* Follow the instructions in the notebooks
* Have fun!

Could always use help with the following:
* Writing tests
* Code review
* Other guidelines
