####

### How do I get set up? ###
**This version is too easy. Just enter the URL you were supplied with**<br>
**into your browser and enter your token when prompted for it.**<br><br>
**It's recommended to create a venv or anaconda-based**<br> 
**kernel for each project you work on, so your dependencies**<br>
**will stay in line.**<br><br>
**This is running within a Docker container of Ubuntu 22.04**<br>
**with CUDA 8.1 and CUDNN 8.9. So the file system in this**<br>
**sandbox is not the same as the file system for the host**<br>
**server itself.**<br>

**Follow the instructions in the notebooks.**<br>
**Have fun!**<br>

### Could always use help with the following: ###
* Writing tests
* Code review
* Other guidelines
